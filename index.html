        <p style="font-size: 20px"> Tired of just visiting sentosa beaches,East Coast beach and Changi Beach because of unclear water?
            Don't worry, you are in luck. St. John Island is now linked to Lazarus Island by a mini courseway bridge.
            Take a 10mins walk from the jetty at St.John Island across the courseway bridge to a secluded beach on Lazarus Island.
            It is a famous place that both local and tourist go to have their diving sessions due to the crystal clear water and beautiful coral bays.
            If you are in luck, you can see many beautiful yachts docked nearby as people visit the island and enjoy the clear water.
